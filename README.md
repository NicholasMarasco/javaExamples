The difference between "Can I?" and "Should I?"

DISCLAIMER:
  
    -Do not take this seriously. 
  
    -This is a monsterous creation of all the worst things you could possibly do.
  
    -This contains the worst coding practices and biggest waste of resources that still accomplishes something.
  
    -If you plan to learn anything from this, let it be to NEVER do any of this.
  
    -If this offends you, I understand. It hurts me to write it as much as it hurts you to read it.
